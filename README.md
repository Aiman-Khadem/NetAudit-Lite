NetAudit-Lite is an educational Python project designed to help beginners understand basic network security concepts.
The tool scans a local or permitted network to identify open ports, demonstrating how unsecured services may expose systems to potential risks.
This project was developed to strengthen my understanding of TCP/IP, ports, basic network reconnaissance, and ethical security assessment principles.
The tool is intended strictly for educational purposes and was tested only on networks I own or have permission to audit.
